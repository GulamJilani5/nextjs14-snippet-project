## 1) Server Action(SA) - whenever we want to mutate(CRUD) data with db we need server actions.
   In this project SA have been used in Server Component(SC) and Client Component(CC).

## 2) Using client component inside server component.
  Showing(importing) client component inside server component.
  Fetching data in server component and passing the response data from the server component to client
  component as props. And client component can use the response data with hooks and event handlers.

## 3) Monaco editor

## 4) Defining And Using(Calling) Server Actions for client component
       DEFINING Two Ways 
                1) Define the SA in SC and pass it props to the client component
                2) Define the SA in a separate file and import it into the lcient component
      CALLING Two Ways 
                1) Using 'form action' with 'bind' mehtod
                2) Uisng 'onclick handler' on button with 'startTransition' function.

## 5) startTransition and bind method
   
       startTransition(scope) - Usefull in a scenario when we don't want to show any UI before 
                                scope function (state change happened here) has happened.
       
       bind -  Create a function with certain arguments pre-set to that function.
